<p>Speech by Mr Heng Swee Keat, Minister for Finance at the Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) Awards and 86th Anniversary Dinner, 26 September 2018, 8:00pm at Resorts World Sentosa</p>

<p>Excellencies, Ambassadors, High Commissioners</p>

<p>Mr Douglas Foo, President, Singapore Manufacturing Federation</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A very good evening. Thank you for inviting me to celebrate the 86th Anniversary of the Singapore Manufacturing Federation and the third iteration of the SMF Awards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few months back, I gave an interview to Zaobao and they asked me: what are your biggest challenges as Finance Minister? I told Zaobao, “As Finance Minister, 钱不够用，时间不够用.” Money not enough, time not enough. So, when I was coming for this evening’s event, somebody asked me, “You said that time not enough, then why are you spending time to go for all these events?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would tell you the first reason, and towards the end, I will tell you the second reason. The first reason is that, some of you would know, Douglas was made Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP), and in his interview and public statements, he said he would like to be an NMP  to champion the manufacturing sector. He would also like to build closer relations with our friends in ASEAN, so I’m very happy to see that so many of you are here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very encouraged to see so many leaders and partners of the manufacturing community here tonight – SMF members, business leaders, heads of trade associations and chambers, and friends from overseas. It shows that SMF is adding value and is valued by your members and partners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, SMF has come a long way and has a very rich history of championing Singapore’s manufacturing sector, since its inception in 1932. Over the past 86 years, you have worked tirelessly to help Singapore companies innovate, increase productivity, transform and expand overseas. SMF is the first Trade Association and Chamber to partner IMDA in the SME Go Digital Programme. I am glad to hear from Douglas the many initiatives that SMF is leading, such as the training internships and Asean portal, under your Strategic Roadmap 2020. I am confident that SMF will continue to play a leadership role in the manufacturing industry. The Government will, on our part, continue to strongly support your work.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="manufacturing-as-key-growth-engine">Manufacturing as key growth engine</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The manufacturing sector is a key engine of economic growth.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. The sector contributes about 20 per cent of Singapore’s GDP and 14 per cent of total employment. Many of your businesses anchor high-value and complex activities in Singapore, that in turn provide skilled jobs for Singaporeans at various levels, including technicians, engineers and researchers.</p>

<p>b. The sector has been doing well, with GDP growth of 10.2 per cent over the previous year. In comparison, the overall economy grew 3.9 per cent in the second quarter this year.</p>

<p>c. Your activities also support those of other sectors such as wholesale trade and business services, and have extensive linkages with other parts of the economy.</p>

<p>d. So, manufacturing will remain a key pillar of our economy for years to come.</p>

<ol>
  <li>However, we are also up against major shifts in the external environment. Manufacturing is a highly globalised and competitive sector. The digitalisation of manufacturing – which some refer to as Industry 4.0 – is transforming the sector globally. Rapid advancement of new technologies such as the industrial Internet-of-things, robotics and cloud computing, together with changes in global supply chains and consumer demand, are affecting business models.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. Let me share a few examples.</p>

<p>i. Digital twinning technology, which creates a digital profile of a product idea, can test and tweak products without a physical prototype. Data from both the virtual and physical versions can be used to further optimise the product. This means companies can make better products, have faster innovation cycles, and reduce production costs.</p>

<p>ii. As digitalisation and connectivity become pervasive, more manufacturers will be able to sell services, in addition to goods. For example, with the advent of ride-sharing technologies, car-makers are now seriously re-thinking whether their business model should centre around selling cars, or if they should offer transport services instead. Likewise, when SMF’s Manufacturing-as-a-Service portal is set up next year, plant owners can consider whether to sublet their underutilised plant capacity as a service to other manufacturers.</p>

<p>b. To remain relevant and competitive, it is important that we make the effort to understand these technologies, and are prepared to adopt and integrate them into business processes. In turn, this will enhance value proposition to customers. Our workforce must similarly be ready to adapt to these changes, acquire new skills, and be redeployed to higher-value tasks.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Our manufacturers are not only confronting technological changes, but are also affected by other global economic forces.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. US-China trade tensions continue to unfold. i. In my conversations with businesses, I know that the risks are on your mind. Singapore’s manufacturers are expecting uncertainty, slow-down in export orders and weak business sentiments.</p>

<p>ii. Our businesses will need to watch the trade war with caution, and continue to innovate, transform and build resilience.</p>

<h2 id="spirit-of-leadership">Spirit of leadership</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Amidst these challenges, there are opportunities. I am confident that our manufacturing sector can overcome these challenges, and remain attractive to the world as a manufacturing hub. But this will not happen if we are slow or make incremental changes. We must act fast, embrace technology, transform our businesses, develop our talent, and be relevant to markets in the region and beyond.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must start with all of you, as leaders of the manufacturing sector. The resilience and success of this sector will depend on the actions you take.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a. In particular, the CEO and top management of every company must actively seek opportunities, overcome obstacles and challenges, and bring your teams together. Successful companies are led by leaders who have the vision to aim high, to spot opportunities, bring the team together to overcome challenges, and move doggedly to pursue their vision.</p>

<p>i. This is the very spirit of the SMF Awards that I have the pleasure of giving out later – the Sustainable Growth Award, Business Model Innovation Award, and Collaborative Partnership Award, which recognise capable leaders and their efforts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tonight, I want to suggest three levels at which we can make significant moves to transform ourselves:</li>
</ol>

<p>a. First, within your company;</p>

<p>b. Second, outside your company, in collaboration with others in the same industry; and</p>

<p>c. Third, outside Singapore, in collaboration with our partners in ASEAN and beyond.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, within your company.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. Leaders need to take ownership of transformation by</p>

<p>i. Charting a path for future growth, and energising the team
around this vision;</p>

<p>ii. Cultivating a spirit of innovation within your firm to build competitive advantages; and</p>

<p>iii. Deepening human and corporate capabilities to position the firm for the future.</p>

<p>b. I am heartened to hear the five repeat winners of the SMF Awards. They may be from different fields – semiconductors, food manufacturing, communications, energy efficiency – but what’s common across them is that they have continued to innovate, moved into higher-value activities, created new revenue streams, enhanced the quality of their products, and ventured abroad.</p>

<p>i. I encourage all of you here to explore how you can take further steps like these, in a way that makes sense for your own sector and circumstances.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Second, even as you transform your company, you can work with others in the same industry to achieve more. If you have seen the recent super-hero movies – The Avengers, or The Incredibles – you know that even super-heroes need each other’s help.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. A good number of firms have already started by using the Industry Transformation Maps, or ITMs, for manufacturing, which were launched progressively over the past few years. i. For example, the Precision Engineering ITM is helping firms to pool resources and increase productivity. Since its launch in 2016, we have 10 digital transformation projects in action now. Firms of different sizes within the industry are participating, and we expect to raise productivity by an average of 30 per cent.</p>

<p>b. Trade Associations and Chambers like SMF also play a leadership role in building capabilities across the community.</p>

<p>i. The SMF’s various SME Centres and the Singapore Innovation and Productivity Institute help firms to implement productivity upgrading projects. I understand that the SME Centre@SMF alone assisted over 5, SMEs last year.</p>

<p>ii. There are many other initiatives that SMF is doing to bring the industry together, such as your conversations on the Future of Manufacturing and tonight’s SMF Awards.</p>

<p>c. Our Government agencies and research institutes, too, will continue to support firms in your transformation effort.</p>

<p>i. To help firms better understand how to adopt and scale Industry 4.0 solutions, EDB launched a self-diagnostic tool called the Singapore Smart Industry Readiness Index, to partner with the German company TUV SUD, last year. We welcome all firms to use this tool.</p>

<p>ii. You can also visit ASTAR’s model factories, to co-develop and test new manufacturing technologies with researchers, before deploying them at your own facilities. The newest factory is at the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre launched last month.</p>

<p>iii. We are also focusing on drawing synergies across the manufacturing ITM cluster, as well as across clusters, to achieve even better outcomes. I welcome your feedback on how we can refine and enhance these maps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Third, to remain competitive and compete regionally and globally, you     will need to go beyond Singapore, tap into regional opportunities, and collaborate with ASEAN partners and global partners.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. The global economic weight is shifting back to Asia. Asia will play a larger role in global trade and investment flows.</p>

<p>i. IMF projects Asia to lead global growth at an average of about 6.4% from now till 2023.</p>

<p>ii. ASEAN and six of its FTA Partners involved in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership are working towards a substantial conclusion, hopefully by the end of this year.</p>

<p>iii. Singapore and China are also working to conclude a substantive upgrade of the China-Singapore FTA by the end of this year.</p>

<p>iv. These will provide Singapore businesses with enhanced trade facilitation, and investment opportunities.</p>

<p>b. ASEAN itself is a region of opportunities. ASEAN has very good potential to be both a manufacturing production base for the world, as well as a source of demand for services and goods. It is expected to be the fourth largest single market in the world by 2030, with annual growth of about 5 per cent per annum. This growth is largely driven from the growing middle class.</p>

<p>c. There are opportunities for our firms to venture and invest in the region.</p>

<p>i. You can be part of the Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific trade show happening next month, which Douglas mentioned earlier. Firms can network, exchange ideas and do business with one another.</p>

<p>ii. As the Chair of ASEAN this year, Singapore has been looking into how we can strengthen regional connectivity and support digital innovations like FinTech and regional payments linkages. Greater regional connectivity will further support intra-ASEAN trade and investment.</p>

<p>iii. I just launched the Networked Trade Platform, or the NTP, this morning. This will improve productivity, boost competitiveness, and create opportunities, bringing real benefits to our businesses. iv. In this regard, the SMF-RHB Collaborative Partnership Award (ASEAN) is a very timely award. It recognises the efforts of firms to seek new markets and growth opportunities, and which have benefited from close collaboration with ASEAN partners.</p>

<p>d. Even as the Government and SMF provide broad frameworks and opportunities for cooperation, it is up to each firm to choose to step forward and build connections. This is not a zero-sum game. If firms across the region can work together, especially those with complementary capabilities, all of us will stand to benefit, and have a better chance of competing globally. In fact, our collaborations can also be with firms from all over the world.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<ol>
  <li>In closing, the manufacturing landscape is going to see major changes in the coming years – from disruptive technologies, the     structural changes in all economies will undergo and the shift of economic centre of gravity to Asia.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. Companies and their top management must therefore adopt a mind-set of seeking to collaborate, within the company, with others in the industry, and outside Singapore with our ASEAN partners, partners in Asia, and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>b. At the same time, SMF, workers, Government agencies, and research institutes need to work together to support firms in their transformation journeys.</p>

<p>c. I am sure that if we press on with our efforts, we will eventually be able to reinvent ourselves, and strengthen Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>On that note, my heartiest congratulations to the winners of the SMF Awards. I hope that you will build on your successes, and grow from strength to strength.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Congratulations also to SMF for 86 years of hard work and enduring support. You have come a long way, and laid a strong foundation for our manufacturing sector to grow. To Douglas, council members, who have just been elected, my heartiest congratulations again and you have a big job ahead, I wish you the very best, as you continue to serve your members and bring them to greater heights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to tell you the second reason why I am here tonight. I am here tonight, with the hope that the little things I said and that you all getting together in partnership, will allow each and every one of you to make more money. Why? Because as Finance Minister, the more money you make, the more taxes I collect! So, you and I are exactly on the same side, and you have every support from us in the Government, certainly from the Finance Ministry, and since I’m also leading the Future Economy Council as well as our National Research Foundation, I will give you every support that I can while wearing various hats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thank you for having me here. I look forward to what we can all achieve together for our businesses and people.</p>
  </li>

Make sure you’re in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> branch. If you aren’t, click the dropdown menu and select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code>.</p>

<p>Open the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages</code> folder, and click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">faq.md</code>. Once in, click the edit button (an icon that looks like a pencil).</p>

<p>The content of Isomer sites are written in Markdown. You can ignore the stuff at the top of the page, between the pair of triple dashes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">---</code>). Type something after the second set of triple dashes. The file should now look something like this:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">FAQ</span>
<span class="na">permalink</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/faq/</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
Hello, Isomer! This is my very first edit!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Scroll to the bottom of the page, and add a simple note of the changes you’ve made under ‘Update faq.md’. You can also add more details in the subsequent large text box. <strong>Make sure the option ‘Commit directly to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> branch.’ is selected, and click ‘Commit changes’.</strong></p>

<p>Wait for about a few minutes, then head to your site’s staging site (which is provided by the isomer team, it typically has this format https://yoursite-staging.netlify.app. On the staging site, head to the FAQ page.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have just made your very first edit to an Isomer site!</p>

<p>The moment a commit is made on GitHub, GitHub sends the updated content of your site to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> that we use to build Isomer sites. Netlify then downloads the central Isomer theme, weaves your content into the theme, building a complete site. This build process usually take less than a minute for most Isomer sites, but larger Isomer sites can take up to 5 minutes.</p>

<p>You might also remember that you were asked to make sure that you are in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> branch of the repository. Isomer sites will always have at least 2 branches - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> branch is where you can make edits freely without affecting your live site. Your changes can be previewed on the staging URL, which is also separate from your live site.</p>

<p>When you’re happy with your changes and want to push them to your live site, open a pull request to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch. A pull request is essentially a request to update the content of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch to be in sync with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> branch. To prevent defacement or other security incidents, we have instituted a policy where your pull request must be approved by at least 1 other user who can edit your site. We’ll cover more about this in the later part of the tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="3-creating-a-new-page">3. Creating a new page</h2>

<p>The next step after editing your first page is to create a new page! As you might recall, each Isomer Markdown file look something like this:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">FAQ</span>
<span class="na">permalink</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/faq/</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
Hello, Isomer! This is my very first edit!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The stuff between the 2 sets of triple dashes is called the <em>front matter</em>. The front matter is where you configure the title and url for each page. Most pages will only have these 2 options (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permalink</code>), but some pages, like the <a href="/configuration/home/overview/">home page</a> and <a href="/configuration/contact/overview/">contact us page</a>, have more.</p>

<p><strong>Note that permalink refers to the url of that particular page on your site. You will notice that permalink looks like this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permalink: /my-page</code>. This is because it is assumed that the full url always starts with www.your-site-name.gov.sg, which is why we omit the first part and only include the part of the url after your main domain.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-isomer-guide/assets/page-anatomy.png" alt="Screenshot of Isomer page with the permalink and title labelled" /></p>

<p>Now that you know about the front matter, let’s get started creating your new page!</p>

<p>Head to the staging branch, and go into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages</code> folder. Click the ‘Create new file’ button (it’s to the upper right hand corner). Give a file a name, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myfirstpage.md</code>. Note that your page is in Markdown format, hence the file name must end in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>. GitHub won’t be able to automatically add that for you!</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-isomer-guide/assets/resources/creating-a-new-file-in-your-repository.gif" alt="Creating a new file in your repository" /></p>

<p>Now that you have named the file, you’re free to add your content. Feel free to copy and paste the Markdown above, or write your own! If your site already has a page with the permalink <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/faq/</code>, remember to change the permalink to something else! One of the 2 pages will not be accessible if they have the same permalinks.</p>

<p>Once you’re done, enter a commit message, make sure the ‘Commit directly to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> branch.’ option is selected, and hit the green commit button. Just as before, your changes are now accessible on the staging site! (you might need to enter the permalink directly into the address bar)</p>

<h2 id="4-publish-a-page-to-live">4. Publish a page to live</h2>

<p>On GitHub, we keep 2 separate copies of each site on 2 separate “branches” - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staging</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>. The staging branch is where you do your editing and preview your edits. Once you’re ready for your edits to go live, you’ll need to “copy” the staging branch to the master branch. This is done using what is known as a pull request.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-isomer-guide/assets/resources/github-creating-pull-request.gif" alt="Creating pull request" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select your “staging” branch</li>
  <li>Click on “New pull request” button</li>
  <li>Select base as master. This is located at the top of the page</li>
  <li>Select your department Reviewers. This is located at the right side of the page</li>
  <li>Put in a title and leave a comment for your reviewer</li>
  <li>Click on “Create pull request” button</li>
</ol>

<p>Do refer to the section below for a guide on how to approve a pull request.</p>

<h1 id="more-about-github-markdown">More about Github, Markdown</h1>

<h2 id="github-1">Github</h2>

<p>Over the course of the past few pages, you’ve created a GitHub account, and have been editing your pages on GitHub. Now, we’ll cover what GitHub is and more importantly, how to use it, in more detail.</p>

<p>Each Isomer site has a GitHub repository. A repository is like a dedicated GitHub folder for your site.</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-isomer-guide/assets/resources/github.PNG" alt="Screenshot of a GitHub Isomer respository" /></p>

<p>GitHub is an online code storage service that many programmers use. It is perfect for storing and collaborating edits to plain text files, such as Markdown, but it supports multimedia files such as Word documents and pictures too. For plain text files, it even tracks the full history of each line, so you can easily go back to find out the author even years after it was written! This makes it perfect for government websites where tracability is important, and also acts as a further line of defence against defacement attacks.</p>

<p>Additionally, we also have a “2 editor policy”, where at least 1 other person must review and approve when the live production site is edited.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT guidelines to follow to manage your repository:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Always upload document such as pdf, doc, excel into the files folder</li>
  <li>Always upload images such as png, jpg, gif into the images folder</li>
  <li>Do not upload filename or permalinks that contain spaces. Always replace the spaces with dash (-)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-markdown">What is markdown?</h2>

<p>Markdown is a way to style text on the web. All the pages on isomer are in markdown format (as you may have noticed by the .md extension on all your pages). You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is simply regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>.</p>

<p>For a quick, interactive introduction to Markdown, you can try out the Markdown tutorial at <a href="https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/" target="_blank">https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/</a>.</p>

<h3 id="quick-cheatsheet-on-markdown-formatting">Quick cheatsheet on Markdown formatting</h3>

<p>This is intended as a quick reference and showcase, to aid you as you draft your site’s pages. If you’re looking for something that isn’t covered here, we encourage you to refer to other more comprehensive Markdown guides on the internet. If you still feel you need more assistance, feel free to reach out to us for help through Slack or email.</p>

<p><a href="https://stackedit.io/app">StackEdit</a> is free online editor that you can use while you draft your pages.</p>

<h4 id="text">Text</h4>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>This is some normal text. <span class="ge">*This sentence is in italics.*</span> This <span class="gs">**word**</span> is in bold.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above Markdown will produce:</p>

<p>This is some normal text. <em>This sentence is in italics.</em> This <strong>word</strong> is in bold.</p>

<h4 id="headers">Headers</h4>

<p>Headers are the big titles and subtitles on your page. For example, the headers you have seen so far on this page are “Text” and “Headers”. Headers come in levels, with a level 1 header (aka <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H1</code>) the biggest level usually used only for page titles.</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gh"># This is a level 1 (H1) header!</span>

<span class="gu">## This is a level 2 (H2) header!</span>

<span class="gu">### This is a level 3 (H3) header!</span>

<span class="gu">#### This is a level 4 (H4) header!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above Markdown will produce:</p>

<p><a href="/opendoc-isomer-guide/assets/headers.png">image of headers</a></p>

<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">1.</span> First ordered list item
<span class="p">2.</span> Another item
<span class="p">  *</span> Unordered sub-list. 
<span class="p">1.</span> Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
<span class="p">  1.</span> Ordered sub-list
<span class="p">4.</span> And another item.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the 3 leading spaces which align the raw Markdown.
<span class="p">
*</span> Use asterisks for unordered lists, aka bullet points
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above Markdown will produce:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First ordered list item</li>
  <li>Another item
    <ul>
      <li>Unordered sub-list.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Actual numbers don’t matter, just that it’s a number</li>
  <li>Ordered sub-list</li>
  <li>
    <p>And another item.</p>

    <p>You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces which align the raw Markdown.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Use asterisks for unordered lists, aka bullet points</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="links">Links</h4>

<p>Links come in several flavours:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">I'm a link within the site</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">/configuration/navbar/overview/</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">I'm an link to an external site</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">https://www.google.com</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">I'm an link with title - hover your mouse over me!</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">https://www.google.com</span> <span class="nn">"Google's Homepage"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">I'm an link to a file</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">/assets/sample.pdf</span><span class="p">)</span>

URLs must be wrapped in angled brackets to turn into links: <span class="nv">&lt;http://www.example.com&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above Markdown will produce:</p>

<p><a href="/configuration/navbar/overview/">I’m a link within the site</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com">I’m an link to an external site</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com" title="Google's Homepage">I’m an link with title - hover your mouse over me!</a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/sample.pdf">I’m an link to a file</a></p>

<p>URLs must be wrapped in angled brackets to turn into links: <a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a></p>

<h4 id="images">Images</h4>

<p>To place an image in your Markdown file, first upload the image into your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/images/</code> folder. Then use the following Markdown syntax:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">![</span><span class="nv">alt text - this is a description of what is in the image for people with visual impairments using screen readers</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">/opendoc-isomer-guide/assets/isomer-logo.svg</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">![</span><span class="nv">just like links, you can include titles which appear when hovered</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">/assets/isomer-logo.svg</span> <span class="nn">"Isomer Logo"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above Markdown will produce:</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-isomer-guide/assets/sample-image.jpg" alt="alt text - this is a description of what is in the image for people with visual impairments using screen readers" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/sample-image.jpg" alt="just like links, you can include titles which appear when hovered" title="Sample Image" /></p>

<h4 id="videos">Videos</h4>

<p>To embed a video on your page, simply copy the iframe code from Youtube or Vimeo after you’ve uploaded your video, and paste it onto your page like this</p>

<p><img src="/opendoc-isomer-guide/assets/video.png" alt="image of iframe code on youtube" /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/88Ft83XvkSY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></p>

<p>The above Markdown will show this:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/88Ft83XvkSY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="what-is-front-matter">What is front matter?</h2>

<p>As covered in the earlier section, the front matter is the stuff enclosed in 3 dashes at the top of the page. The front matter is used to configure the settings specific to that page, such as the title and permalink. Certain pages like the homepage and contact us page have more configuration options, such as the content in the hero banner or the contact numbers displayed.</p>

<p>The way the front matter is structured is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" target="blank">YAML</a>. You can think of it as a language used to specify data in a way that can be read and understoof by Isomer.</p>

<h3 id="front-matter-syntax">Front matter syntax</h3>

<p>ike all languages, YAML has its own ‘grammar’, known as syntax. Syntax are a list of rules that you have to follow in order for the YAML to be properly understood. There are quite a number of rules in YAML, but we’ll just cover what you need to know.</p>

<p>The most important thing in YAML is the spacing. Certain lines have extra spaces at the front. See this sample extract from a home page’s front matter:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">resources</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Media</span>
  <span class="na">subtitle</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Learn more</span>
  <span class="na">button</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Contact Us</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example, there is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resources</code> section. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subtitle</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">button</code> properties each have 2 spaces at the front. This means that the 3 properties are describing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resources</code> section, instead of the whole page.</p>

<p>The next thing you should know about YAML are lists. Here’s an extract from a dropdown menu:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">options</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Option A</span>
    <span class="na">url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/page-a/</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Option B</span> 
    <span class="na">url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/page-b/</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Option C</span>
    <span class="na">url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/page-c/</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A dropdown menu will have multiple options. This is when we need to use a list. Each item in a list is specified by adding a dash (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code>). Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">url</code>, which is part of the option together with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code>, must be vertically aligned with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code>.</p>

<p>This is more or less what you need to know for YAML. Don’t worry if you don’t know the specific options to use for each page - you can always refer to the <a href="/configuration/navbar/overview/">configuration options</a> for the details. All you need right now is to understand when the extra spaces are needed, and when lists are needed.</p>

<p>As a final note, if you have special characters like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> in your YAML, it is a good idea to wrap the entire text in double quotes, like so:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">#hashtags"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before you begin this tutorial, make sure the skeletal site has been prepared by us. If you have yet to contact us, see the <a href="/get-started/">Get Started</a> page.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll be making 2 simple edits to familiarise yourself with the editing process. We’ll also provide resources that you can use to get yourself more comfortable with Isomer and the way to use it. Whether or not you have gone through our on-site training, this tutorial should get you up to speed so that you can start populating your Isomer site with content.</p>

<p>To recap, Isomer takes in the content you write, and “builds” a fully functional site. You do not need to manage the design or look and feel of the site beyond the site colours. The Isomer team will also manage the hosting and day-to-day operation of your site.</p>

<h3 id="go-to-your-settings-1">Go to your settings</h3>

<p>After verification, you will need to do some additional set-up.</p>

<p>Go to your account settings by clicking on your profile picture on the top right hand corner of the page.</p>

<p>Select ‘Settings’ and you will be redirected to a new page.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/github-setup/5.png" alt="Screenshot of the GitHub with the settings option on the top right selected" /></p>

<p>On the left-hand side of the page, look for the ‘Security’ tab and select it. Here, we will be setting up two-factor authentication (2FA).</p>

<h3 id="enable-2fa-1">Enable 2FA</h3>

<p>Before working on Isomer websites, you will have to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) to secure your account. Note that 2FA is required for all Isomer repositories.</p>

<p>Click on ‘Enable two-factor authentication’ to proceed.</p>

<h3 id="choose-2fa-authentication-method-1">Choose 2FA authentication method</h3>

<p>Select a 2FA authentication method. You have a choice between using an app (such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2">Google Authenticator</a>, <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a>, or <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>), or via an SMS message.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/github-setup/8.png" alt="Screenshot of the GitHub 2FA selection page" /></p>

<h3 id="save-your-recovery-codes-1">Save your recovery codes</h3>

<p>GitHub will prompt you to save your recovery codes. The purpose of these codes are to gurantee you are the owner of your account in case your 2FA fails, such as when you lose your phone.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage saving these codes somewhere secure.</p>

<p>After selecting one of the methods to save the codes, the ‘Next’ button will be enabled. Proceed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/github-setup/9.png" alt="Screenshot of the GitHub recovery codes" /></p>

<h3 id="complete-2fa-setup-1">Complete 2FA setup</h3>

<p>Set up your 2FA as prompted by GitHub. You’ll be prompted for a ‘trial run’ of your 2FA, where you must enter the generated 2FA code to make sure that your 2FA setup is working in order to proceed. Once done, click ‘Enable’ to enable 2FA on your account.</p>

<p>You will then see a banner notifying you that ‘Two-factor authentication successfully enabled’.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/github-setup/10.png" alt="Screenshot of the GitHub banner saying 'Two-factor authentication successfully enabled'" /></p>

<p>Now you are ready to gain access to your Isomer website repository.</p>
