# Introduction to Isomer

Isomer is made of a few services. 
### Github
This is where you **edit** your content. Most of the tutorial in this guide will cover tips and tricks on how you edit your site on Github
### Netlify
This is where your **sites are hosted**. All the content pages on Github are pulled by Netlify and it builds your site into html pages that users see on browsers. 
You don't have to know too much about this as this part is handled by the isomer team. 
### KeyCDN
As the name suggests, KeyCDN is a CDN (Content Delivery Network) service. It makes sure that your site is always up, fast and it also protects against DDoS (Distributed denial of service) attacks. KeyCDN is also where we install your SSL certs and your site content is served whenever a user hits your url such as www.isomer.gov.sg.

To start using isomer, follow the steps listed below. 

## 1. Create a Github account

### Sign up

Go to <https://github.com/>{:target="_blank"}. Proceed to sign up for an account using your preferred email address and a professional username. The email address used must be connected to the internet.

You will only need a basic account on GitHub to edit the content of your Isomer website.

Under 'Choose your subscription', select 'Free' to opt for the free plan.

Click on 'Continue' when the correct option is selected.

### Verify your email

After signing up, go to your registered email address. You would've received an email to verify your email address.

Proceed with the verification.

Upon returning to GitHub, you will see a banner notification that your email is verified.

### Go to your settings

After verification, you will need to do some additional set-up.

Go to your account settings by clicking on your profile picture on the top right hand corner of the page.

Select 'Settings' and you will be redirected to a new page.

On the left-hand side of the page, look for the 'Security' tab and select it. Here, we will be setting up two-factor authentication (2FA).

### Enable 2FA

Before working on Isomer websites, you will have to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) to secure your account. Note that 2FA is required for all Isomer repositories.

Click on ‘Enable two-factor authentication’ to proceed.

### Choose 2FA authentication method

Select a 2FA authentication method. You have a choice between using an app (such as [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2), [Authy](https://authy.com/), or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)), or via an SMS message.

### Save your recovery codes

GitHub will prompt you to save your recovery codes. The purpose of these codes are to gurantee you are the owner of your account in case your 2FA fails, such as when you lose your phone.

We strongly encourage saving these codes somewhere secure.

After selecting one of the methods to save the codes, the 'Next' button will be enabled. Proceed.

### Complete 2FA setup

Set up your 2FA as prompted by GitHub. You'll be prompted for a 'trial run' of your 2FA, where you must enter the generated 2FA code to make sure that your 2FA setup is working in order to proceed. Once done, click 'Enable' to enable 2FA on your account.

You will then see a banner notifying you that 'Two-factor authentication successfully enabled'.

Now you are ready to gain access to your Isomer website repository.

### Request an invite

Now that your account is all set up. You will need an invite to make edits to your website.

To gain access, email the Isomer Team at <admin@isomer.gov.sg> with your GitHub username and website.

Upon being added to the repository, you will receive an invite on your registered email.
