# Introduction

Before you begin this tutorial, make sure the skeletal site has been prepared by us. If you have yet to contact us, see the [Get Started](/get-started/) page.

In this tutorial, you'll be making 2 simple edits to familiarise yourself with the editing process. We'll also provide resources that you can use to get yourself more comfortable with Isomer and the way to use it. Whether or not you have gone through our on-site training, this tutorial should get you up to speed so that you can start populating your Isomer site with content.

To recap, Isomer takes in the content you write, and "builds" a fully functional site. You do not need to manage the design or look and feel of the site beyond the site colours. The Isomer team will also manage the hosting and day-to-day operation of your site.
